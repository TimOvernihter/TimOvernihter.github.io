Hi! This is a beginning of my blog about technologies. Firstly, I think that you already know what this website is mainly about. Besides the latest news and innovations, I will try to make it my own platform of expressing opinions and ideas. I think that every person who uses PC should know what he/she is interacting with. My goal is to sort out the structure of our-everyday-assistants and their functioning principles in a funny way so as to follow their progress in future. 
<p>Let's get started!</p>
<p>(Hope you'll enjoy)</p>
